# AudioHush - A noise Reduction Web App

This web application allows users to reduce background noise from videos by leveraging the power of `ffmpeg`. Simply provide a direct link to the video, and our server will process it asynchronously using `ffmpeg` to deliver a noise-free version.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

2. Install dependencies:

3. Start the server:

4. Access the web application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## How it Works

1. **Upload a Video**: Instead of uploading videos, users should provide a direct link to the video file. Links from services like Google Drive or Dropbox are accepted.

2. **Processing Queue**: Once the user submits a video link, it is added to a processing queue. Due to the potentially time-consuming nature of `ffmpeg` processing, it is handled asynchronously in a background worker.

3. **Task ID**: After submitting the video, the user is provided with a unique task ID or job ID. They are instructed to check back after a few minutes.

4. **Check Progress**: Users can return to the web app later and enter their task ID to check the processing status.

 - If the video is processed, a download link will be provided, allowing the user to retrieve the noise-reduced video.
 - If the video is still in the queue, the user will be informed that it is "queued up" and should check back later.
 - If the processing fails, an appropriate error message will be displayed.

## Tech Stack

The project is built using the following technologies and tools:

- **Node/Express**: The web application user interface is developed using Node.js and Express framework.

- **Background Job Processor**: To handle asynchronous processing, we utilize a background job processor such as [Bull](https://github.com/OptimalBits/bull) or [node-resque](https://github.com/actionhero/node-resque). You can choose the one that suits your requirements.

- **Redis**: If needed, Redis can be integrated to support the background job processing and task management.

- **Database**: We recommend using a suitable database system like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB to store task details and metadata.

- **ffmpeg**: The `ffmpeg` command line tool is employed to remove noise from the videos.
